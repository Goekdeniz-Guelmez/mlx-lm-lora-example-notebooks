    "  - No extra `<think>` tags → 0 (penalty if multiple)\n",

    "✅ LoRA + quantization enables efficient training on Mac  \n",
    "✅ GRPO optimizes based on relative ranking (no value function needed)  \n",

    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Experiment with reward weights**: Adjust `custom_reward_weights` to emphasize different aspects\n",
    "2. **Try different loss types**: Test `bnpo` or `dr_grpo` variants\n",
    "3. **Scale up**: Use more training data if you have sufficient RAM\n",
    "4. **Evaluate systematically**: Test on held-out math problems to measure improvement\n",
    "5. **Apply to other domains**: Adapt reward functions for coding, logical reasoning, etc.\n",
